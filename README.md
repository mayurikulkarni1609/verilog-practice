# Verilog Practice

This repository contains my Verilog practice designs and testbenches
as I learn digital design and HDL-based simulation.

Each module includes:
- RTL Verilog code
- A corresponding testbench
- Simulation waveform screenshots (GTKWave)

## Current Designs

### 2:1 Multiplexer
- mux21.v        : RTL design
- tb_mux21.v     : Testbench
- waveform_mux21.png : Simulation waveform
